"Can Middle Oceanic Spreading Ridges be swallowed by a subduction zone?
Middle oceanic ridges are places where new oceanic crust is generated. Does anybody know what happens to these spreading ridges when the oceanic basin starts to be closed? Is there any possibility that the once-active middle oceanic ridge be swallowed into the mantle at a oceanic-continental plate convergence boundary? ","Ridge subduction is an obvious phenomena, as oldest ocean floor is only 200-180Mys. And is possibly one of the mechanism to justify the magmatism within the near-trench fore-arc region, which is otherwise a refrigerated zone. We recently, discussed this subject in Early Cretaceous ridge subduction beneath southern Alaska: I..."," 

Yes, it is possible for middle oceanic spreading ridges to be swallowed by a subduction zone. As an oceanic basin closes, the oceanic crust is subjected to compressional forces that can cause it to be subducted into the mantle. This process is known as subduction.

Subduction occurs when the leading edge of a tectonic plate is forced beneath another plate. As the overlying plate continues to move, the subducted plate is pulled deeper into the mantle, where it is recycled into the Earth's mantle.

Middle oceanic ridges are typically located at the boundary between two oceanic plates, and as the oceanic basin closes, the ridges can be subjected to subduction. The rate at which the ridges are subducted depends on the rate at which the oceanic basin is closing, as well as the angle"

"Which of the following sentences about infrared waves is true?They can be used to treat cancerous tumours.They can be used to make images of bones, through the skin.They can be used for cooking.They are used to send communication signals to satellites. ","The correct answer is C because: Infrared waves are the type of electromagnetic wave emitted by objects (the hotter the object, the more IR it emits).
When infrared waves of sufficient intensity are incident on an object, they cause it to heat up. Infrared waves can, therefore, be used for cooking in ovens.
Some students may believe that only microwaves can be used for cooking...clearly they have never used an oven or a toaster.
This is more apparent in the Thermal Processes topic, 2.3. A is incorrect as x-rays and γ-rays can be used to treat tumours.
B is incorrect as x-rays can be used to make images of bones.
D is incorrect as microwaves are used to send communication signals to satellites.","  Which of the following sentences about infrared waves is true?
A) They can be used to treat cancerous tumors.
B) They can be used to make images of bones through the skin.
C) They can be used for cooking.
D) They are used to send communication signals to satellites.

The answer is (B) They can be used to make images of bones through the skin. Infrared waves are used in medical imaging techniques such as thermal imaging or infrared photography to create images of the body's internal structures, including bones, through the skin. This is because different types of tissue absorb or reflect infrared radiation differently, allowing for the creation of images based on temperature differences.

","Just a thought; evolution is an essential aspect of a dynamic world, i.e., in which time exists. Let us assume two states, A and B occur at different times. From a dynamics point of view, a stable system will reach an equilibrium point after the introduction of certain disruptions in the system. The disruptions cause the system to undergo transient state, i.e., an evolution from one point (A) to another (B) until it reaches an equilibrium point, thereafter the system state becaomes constant if no further disruption is introduced to it. A world can be viewed as a system with a collection of all matters (animated and unanimated) and energy (in all sorts of forms). From time to time certain species of plants, animals or insects emerge while others disappear, however the total mass-energy remains the same in the system. The animals or plants that continue to exist from state to state must evolve according to the criterion (or criteria) imposed by the system, otherwise, they too will completely disappear and replaced by other forms of objects, whose existence fulfill the crietrion set by the system. The question now becomes, in our world what is this criterion?
