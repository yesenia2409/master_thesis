"Can Middle Oceanic Spreading Ridges be swallowed by a subduction zone?
Middle oceanic ridges are places where new oceanic crust is generated. Does anybody know what happens to these spreading ridges when the oceanic basin starts to be closed? Is there any possibility that the once-active middle oceanic ridge be swallowed into the mantle at a oceanic-continental plate convergence boundary? ","Ridge subduction is an obvious phenomena, as oldest ocean floor is only 200-180Mys.

Middle oceanic ridges are places where new oceanic crust is generated through the process of seafloor spreading. 2. When an oceanic basin starts to close due to a convergent boundary between an oceanic plate and a continental plate, the fate of the middle oceanic ridge depends on several factors. 3. If the subduction zone forms behind the ridge, the ridge will not be directly affected by the subduction process. Instead, the ridge will be pushed away from the subduction zone as the oceanic plate is forced down into the mantle. 4. However, if the subduction zone forms ahead of the ridge, the ridge may be directly affected by the subduction process. In this case, the ridge may be partially or completely consumed by the subduction zone. 5. The exact fate of the ridge in this scenario depends on the geometry of the subdu"

"Which of the following sentences about infrared waves is true?They can be used to treat cancerous tumours.They can be used to make images of bones, through the skin.They can be used for cooking.They are used to send communication signals to satellites.

When infrared waves of sufficient intensity are incident on an object, they cause it to heat up. Infrared waves can, therefore, be used for cooking in ovens.
Some students may believe that only microwaves can be used for cooking...clearly they have never used an oven or a toaster.

","Just a thought; evolution is an essential aspect of a dynamic world, i.e., in which time exists. Let us assume two states, A and B occur at different times. From a dynamics point of view, a stable system will reach an equilibrium point after the introduction of certain disruptions in the system. The disruptions cause the system to undergo transient state, i.e., an evolution from one point (A) to another (B) until it reaches an equilibrium point, thereafter the system state becaomes constant if no further disruption is introduced to it. A world can be viewed as a system with a collection of all matters (animated and unanimated) and energy (in all sorts of forms). From time to time certain species of plants, animals or insects emerge while others disappear, however the total mass-energy remains the same in the system. The animals or plants that continue to exist from state to state must evolve according to the criterion (or criteria) imposed by the system, otherwise, they too will completely disappear and replaced by other forms of objects, whose existence fulfill the crietrion set by the system. The question now becomes, in our world what is this criterion? If we know about this criterion, then it is possible to predict our next evelotuion, and the evolution of our enviornments even before they take place."," 1.
