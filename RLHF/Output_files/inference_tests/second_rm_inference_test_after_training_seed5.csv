Write a function to convert a text string into an integer.  [/INST]","Here's one way you could write such a function in Python:

```python
def text_to_int(text):
    # Removing any white space before or after the text and converting it to lower case
    text = text.strip().lower()
    
    # Dictionary of numbers in words and their integer equivalents
    numbers_dict = { ""zero"": 0, ""one"": 1, ""two"": 2, ""three"": 3, ""four"": 4, ""five"": 5, ""six"": 6, ""seven"": 7, ""eight"": 8, ""nine"": 9 }
    
    # Splitting the text into a list
    text_list = text.split()
    number = 0

    # Looping through the text list to add up the numbers
    for word in text_list:
        if word in numbers_dict:
            number = number*10 + numbers_dict[word]
        else:
            raise ValueError(f""'{word}' is not a valid number."")
    
    return number
```

This function takes in the text string as input and returns the integer representation of the text. It handles white spaces before and after the text and converts the text to lower case. The dictionary contains the numbers in word form as keys and their integer equivalents as values. It then splits the text into a list of string and uses a loop to iterate through the list to add up the numbers. If the word is not present in the dictionary, then it raises a ValueError.

Here is an example of how you can use this function:

```python
text = ""one two three four""
result = text_to_int(text)
print(result) # prints 1234
