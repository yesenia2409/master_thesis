Please extract the named entities in: The first fly fossil discovered from the Upper Jurassic Talbragar Fish Bed in Australia is described and illustrated. Based on a single, well preserved wing, Calosargus (Calosargus) talbragarensis new species is assigned to the extinct brachyceran family Archisargidae. Wing morphology suggests a relationship between this extinct family and Stratiomyidae. The Archisargidae have so far only been found in China, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Calosargus Mostovski, 1997 currently comprises seven species from the Callovian (late Middle Jurassic) of China and three species from the Oxfordian (early Upper Jurassic) of Kazakhstan. This oldest brachyceran fossil from Australia and first record of the Archisargidae in the southern hemisphere presents evidence that higher flies were present in this region in the Jurassic, when this group is thought to have commenced its diversification..

Does anyone have experience developing an evaporite karst distribution model?
I am working with a student to model the distribution of karst in Nova Scotia, Canada, where most karst is underlain by gypsum. We want to map areas with moderate to high probability of surface karst development (we're primarily interested in sink-hole occurrence (dolines)). In addition to bedrock geology, factors that we are considering include depth to water table (previously modelled), overburden depth, and soil porosity (indexed by % of clay in soil). Does anyone have experience with this kind of research? We want to select appropriate parameters for each of these variables (e.g., what depth of overburden, depth to water table, etc.).  [/INST] I have a similar project in the works, and I'm using a similar approach. I'm using a combination of GIS and a statistical model to predict the likelihood of sinkholes in a given area.

Could you extract the terms related to earth science mentioned in this passage? The passage: Traditionalist theology, sometimes referred to as the Atharī school, derives its name from the word "tradition" as a translation of the Arabic word hadith or from the Arabic word athar, meaning "narrations". The traditionalist creed is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation. They rely on the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and sayings of the Sahaba, seeing this as the middle path where the attributes of Allah are accepted without questioning their nature (bi-la kayf). Ahmad ibn Hanbal is regarded as the leader of the traditionalist school of creed. The modern Salafi movement associates itself with the Atharī creed.

What is the influence of chemistry on static liquefaction?
There are quite a number of factors that influence the static and cyclic liquefaction phenomenon of a geomaterial (tailings or soil) such as confining pressure, initial void ratio, initial stress condition, amount and content of fines, sample preparation method, over consolidation ratio, length of time under sustained pressure etc. Also, authors such as Gratchev et al. (2006) and many others have carried out a series of tests using plasticity index as a benchmark for assessing cyclic behaviour of soil, however, the plasticity index still does not fully capture the whole factors that influence the soil strength under cyclic stress. I would like to know the influence of chemistry on the liquefaction of both montmorillonite and kaoline clay tailings.  [/INST] Dear Dr. Akindele,

Please extract the named entities in: An example of parasitic drilling in a rhynchonelliform brachiopod is described from the Shiyanhe Formation (Katian, Upper Ordovician) of Henan, central China. The boring extends into the shell almost perpendicular to the surface. The shell has been serially sectioned, and the trace (including boring and bioclaustration) has been modeled in three dimensions. Healing of the shell evident in serial sections supports a long-term relationship between the brachiopod and borer that we interpret as parasitic. Platyceratid gastropods, found at the same locality as these brachiopods, are the most likely drilling organism. Previous reports of Paleozoic brachiopod parasitic traces can be classified into two main groups, constructive association and destructive association, depending on whether parasites damage brachiopod shells. The example in this study belongs to the second type as the brachiopod shell has been partly damaged by the borer..  [/INST] The named entities in the passage can be listed as follows:
