The minerals formed in this zone are usually clay minerals, such as kaolinite, montmorillonite, and illite. These minerals are formed when the ions in the rainwater are reconnected with the minerals in the soil, creating",1

 E. They live in many temperature niches. ",B," 
The answer is: 

B. Their metabolic processes break down. 
 
Explanation: 

Thermal pollution is a problem for marine organisms because their metabolic processes break down when the water temperature is too high. This is because the enzymes that facilitate metabolic processes are denatured at high temperatures, making it difficult for the organisms to carry out their normal physiological functions. This can lead to a decrease in the population of marine organisms and can also affect the overall health of the ecosystem.

 E. temperature inversion ",E," #E 
 
The correct answer is: E. temperature inversion 
 
The term temperature inversion refers to a situation where the temperature increases with altitude, which is the opposite of the normal situation where the temperature decreases with altitude. This occurs when a layer of warm air moves over a layer of cooler air, causing the warm air to rise and the cooler air to sink. This can lead to the formation of smog, as the warm air is unable to rise high enough to dissipate the pollutants that are present in the air.

Explanation: European cities have historically had narrow streets and low-rise buildings in their CBDs, which are often characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, and a focus on pedestrian-friendly and public transportation-friendly design. This is in contrast to many world cities, which have high-rise buildings and wide streets, and are often designed with a focus on automobile traffic.
