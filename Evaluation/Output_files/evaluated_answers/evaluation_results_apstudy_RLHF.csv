The correct answer is #E. secondary succession.

Secondary succession is a process of ecological succession in which a new ecosystem develops on a site that has previously been disturbed or damaged, such as through urbanization or natural disasters. This process involves the colonization of the site by new species, often from nearby areas or from long-distance dispersal. Secondary succession can be seen in many different types of ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands.

 A. lithification 
 B. leaching 
 C. evapotranspiration 
 D. extinction 
 E. radioactivity ",B," #1: A. Lithification

The figure above shows the nitrogen cycle. It is a process in which nitrogen is converted from one form to another. The process starts with the fixation of nitrogen by blue-green algae and bacteria. Then, nitrogen is released from the soil through leaching, and it is converted into nitrates by nitrifying bacteria. Nitrates are then taken up by plants, and they are converted back into nitrogen through denitrification.
