The theory that explains the movement of the Earth's plates and the contact between them is known as plate tectonics. 
 
 
The Coriolis effect is the deflection of air masses and ocean currents due to the rotation of the Earth. 

The hotspots are the areas where the magma rises to the surface. 

The Richter Magnitude Scale is the scale used to measure the magnitude of the earthquakes. 

The subduction zone is the area where one plate is forced under another.
