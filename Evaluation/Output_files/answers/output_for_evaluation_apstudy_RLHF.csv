The Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates is known as the subduction zone. 
The correct answer is #E. 
The subduction zone is the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates. 
The subduction zone is the process by which the Earth's crust is broken up into large land plates. The land plates are then carried by convection currents in the Earth's mantle. The subduction zone is a region"

Archaeologists record the top layers first, followed by older, deeper layers to study ancient settlements and cities following the 
principle of original horizontality. 
The principle of uniformitarianism states that the processes that shape the Earth's surface today are the same processes that shaped it in the past. 
The principle of superposition states that the oldest layers of rock are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the top. 
The principle of uniformity states that the laws of nature are the same throughout the Earth and that the Earth is a"
