Stratigraphic structures are important in understanding the geological history of an area, as they provide a record of the changes that have occurred over time. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"

The Wilson cycle is a geological cycle that describes the formation of continents and oceans. It is named after the American geologist, Grove Karl Gilbert, who first proposed the idea in the late 19th century. The Wilson cycle is a continuous process that involves the formation of continents, the breakup of continents, and the formation of new oceans. It is driven by the movement of the Earth's plates and the resulting changes in the Earth's surface.

The Wilson cycle consists of three stages:

1. Continental formation: In this stage, continents form through the accumulation of sediment and the cooling of the Earth's mantle.

2. Continental breakup: In this stage, continents break up and separate due to the movement of the Earth's plates.

3. Ocean formation: In this stage, new oceans form between the separated continents.

The Wilson cycle is an ongoing process that has been occurring for billions of years and will continue to occur for billions of years to come. It is an important part of the Earth's geological history and has played a"

The Luliang Movement (Chinese: 鹿领运动) was a mass movement that took place in China during the 1920s and 1930s. It was initiated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and aimed to mobilize the peasants and workers to fight against the Nationalist government and the landlord class. The movement was named after the Luliang region in Shanxi Province, where it originated. The Luliang Movement was a significant event in the history of the CCP and played an important role in the development of the Chinese revolution. "

The formation of halite is closely related to the arid climate. Under dry climate conditions, due to massive evaporation of water and increasing salinity in the water body, rock salt crystallizes when the salinity reaches saturation. Most of the halite pseudocrystals seen in the rocks are isolated and scattered crystals. It is speculated that the halite was not dried up in the whole basin when it was formed, but only occurred in some shallow water sections. The rock salt crystals are covered by sediments after growing, and dissolved due to the reduction of salinity of seawater. The remaining voids are filled with clay components, thus preserving the crystal form of rock salt, so it is called rock salt pseudo-crystal. The rocks are mainly fine-grained sediments, indicating that the terrain was flat at that time, representing the deposition of coastal or lakeside areas under dry climate conditions. The environment is usually judged according to the fossils contained in this set of rocks and its upper and lower strata. If there are marine fossils, it may be coastal sediments.

The term Molasse construction is a concept in geoscience. 

The definition of Molasse construction is that Molasse construction, in geology, a type of sedimentary structure in which a layer of molasse (a mixture of clay, silt, and sand) is deposited on top of a layer of sand or gravel. The molasse is formed when the sand or gravel is eroded and transported by water or wind, and then deposited in a new location. The molasse layer is often irregular in shape and may be several meters thick. It is commonly found in areas where there has been significant erosion or deposition of sediment, such as along rivers or coastlines.

The concept Molasse construction is part of the broader concept Geoscience.

It is named after Beno Gutenberg, who first identified it in the 1920s. The discontinuity is characterized by a sudden change in the seismic velocity of the Earth's mantle, from about 4.5 km/s in the upper mantle to about 3.5 km/s in the lower mantle. This change in seismic velocity is thought to be due to a change in the composition of the mantle, with the upper mantle being composed primarily of olivine and pyroxene, while the lower mantle is composed primarily of olivine and spinel. The Gutenberg discontinuity is important in understanding the structure and composition of the Earth's mantle, and it has implications for the study of earthquakes and the movement of tectonic plates.
