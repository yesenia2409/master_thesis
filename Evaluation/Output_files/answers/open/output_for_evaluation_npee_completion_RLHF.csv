#2: Chemical weathering occurs when rocks are broken down by chemical reactions, such as the formation of acids, the oxidation of iron, and the dissolution of minerals.

#3: Physical weathering occurs when rocks are broken down by physical forces, such as wind, water, and ice.

#4: Chemical weathering is a slow process that can occur over thousands of years, while physical weathering is a faster process that can occur in a matter of months or years.

#5: The rate of weathering can be influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, humidity, and the presence of water and oxygen.

#6: Weathering can result in the formation of soil, which is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, and water.
