The correct answer is #B. 
The umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates is known as #B. plate tectonics. 
The Coriolis effect is the apparent deflection of moving objects on the surface of the Earth due to the rotation of the planet. It is not the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates.
The Richter Magnitude Scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes"

 A. Oxygen and methane 
 B. Oxygen and propane 
 C. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide 
 D. Benzene and nitrogen 
 E. Nitrogen and oxygen [/INST] </s>",E," #E 
The correct answer is E. Nitrogen and oxygen. 
The Earth's atmosphere is composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases. 
The other options are incorrect because:

A. Oxygen and methane are not the majority of the Earth's gases.
B. Oxygen and propane are not the majority of the Earth's gases.
C. Nitrogen and carbon dioxide are not the majority of the Earth's gases.

 D. principle of superposition 
 E. principle of lateral continuity [/INST] </s>",E," #D 
The correct answer is D. principle of superposition. 
 
The principle of superposition states that any sedimentary rock layer is younger than the one above it. This means that the oldest rocks are at the bottom of the sequence and the youngest rocks are at the top. 
 
The principle of uniformity states that the geological processes that occurred in the past are the same as the ones that occur today. This means that the geological processes that formed the rocks in the past are the same as the ones that form the rocks today.
