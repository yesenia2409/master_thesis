Crustal movement can indeed be divided into horizontal movement and vertical movement according to the direction of movement. The Earth's crust is in constant motion, and it can be described as a series of horizontal and vertical movements.

Horizontal movement refers to the movement of the Earth's crust in the horizontal plane, such as the expansion and contraction of the Earth's mantle that causes the Earth's surface to stretch and compress horizontally.

 Please state if the following question is true or false:  There is no groundwater in magmatic rock area ," # True.

Magmatic rocks, also known as igneous rocks, are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. These rocks do not contain any significant amounts of groundwater, as the high temperatures and pressures within the Earth's crust do not allow for the presence of liquid water.

In an anticline structure, the rock strata in the central part are typically older than the strata on either side of the structure. This is because the strata on either side of the anticline have been compressed and folded, causing them to be younger than the strata in the central part. The central part of the anticline, which is the highest point of the structure, contains the oldest rocks, as they have been pushed up and exposed through the folding process.","  True.
