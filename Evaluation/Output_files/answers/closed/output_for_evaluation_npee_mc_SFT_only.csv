 Detrital particles with good roundness generally have higher sphericity [/INST] </s>",False," #Sphericity is a measure of the roundness of a particle. It is calculated by dividing the particle's volume by the volume of a sphere with the same surface area. The higher the sphericity, the more round the particle is.

Detrital particles with good roundness generally have higher sphericity because they have been transported and sorted by water or wind, which tends to round them off. This is especially true for particles that have been transported over long distances, as they have had more time to be rounded by the action of the transporting medium.

In contrast, particles that have"
