* Gneiss-shaped structures are formed when rocks are subjected to high pressure and temperature, causing them to recrystallize and form", #B  ," # The answer is:
 
A. Stomatal, almond-shaped, thousand-piece
 
The explanation is:
 
Stomatal, almond-shaped, thousand-piece structures are the most common type of structures that can coexist in the same type of rocks. They are formed due to the contraction of the rock as it cools and solidifies.
