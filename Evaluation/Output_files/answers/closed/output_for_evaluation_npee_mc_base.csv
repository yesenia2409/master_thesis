To answer your question, if the younger rock block is exposed in the older rock block due to strong erosion, the structure is called a #thrust fault. 🤯

A thrust fault is a type of fault where the younger rock is pushed up and over the older rock, creating a sense of overthrusting. This can occur due to tectonic forces, such as plate movement or compression, and can result in the exposure of the younger rock at the surface. ��"
