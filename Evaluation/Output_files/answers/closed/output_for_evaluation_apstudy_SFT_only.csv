Genetic drift is the change in gene frequency in a population over time. It is a random process that can lead to the loss or fixation of alleles in a population. 
 
The founder effect is the phenomenon where a small group of individuals from a larger population establishes a new population, and the genetic characteristics of the founders become predominant in the new population. 
 
Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides into two daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. It is not related to"

The rule of 70 is used to estimate population doubling. 
 
The rule of 70 is a simple way to estimate the time it takes for a population to double. It is based on the idea that if a population grows at a constant rate, it will double in size in approximately 70 years. This is because the population grows by a factor of 2 every 70 years.
 
For example, if a population grows at a rate of 2% per year, it will double in size in approximately 70 years. This is because 2"

 Why is thermal pollution a problem for marine organisms? 
 A. They are hot-blooded and overheat. 
 B. Their metabolic processes break down. 
 C. They are adapted to wide temperature ranges. 
 D. They don't have a problem with it. 
 E. They live in many temperature niches. [/INST] </s>",B," 
The answer is: 

B. Their metabolic processes break down. 
 
Explanation: 

Thermal pollution is a problem for marine organisms because their metabolic processes break down when the water temperature is too high. This is because the enzymes that facilitate metabolic processes are denatured at high temperatures, making it difficult for the organisms to carry out their normal physiological functions. This can lead to a decrease in the population of marine organisms and can also affect the overall health of the ecosystem.

The correct answer is: E. temperature inversion 
 
The term temperature inversion refers to a situation where the temperature increases with altitude, which is the opposite of the normal situation where the temperature decreases with altitude. This occurs when a layer of warm air moves over a layer of cooler air, causing the warm air to rise and the cooler air to sink. This can lead to the formation of smog, as the warm air is unable to rise high enough to dissipate the pollutants that are present in the air.

 A primary problem with a communist system of agriculture, as compared to the capitalist system, is that 
 A. there is no incentive to produce over a quota 
 B. the demand for products was never high enough to generate income 
 C. individuals produce far more product than necessary and demand lowers 
 D. there is a decentralized agricultural network that leads to high transportation costs 
 E. the reward for producing excess crop is limited to the social elite [/INST] </s>",A," #A 
 
The correct answer is #A. There is no incentive to produce over a quota. 
 
In a communist system of agriculture, the government sets a quota for each farmer or agricultural collective to produce a certain amount of crops or livestock. If the farmer or collective produces more than the quota, they do not receive any additional reward or incentive. This can lead to a lack of motivation for farmers to produce more than the quota, as they will not receive any additional benefits for doing so.

The demographic transition model is a theory that explains how population growth and structure change as a society moves from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economy. The model has three stages: 1) high birth and death rates, 2) high birth rates and declining death rates, and 3) low birth and death rates. The upper and middle sectors of society are most affected by the demographic transition model because they are the ones who are most likely to have access to education, healthcare, and other resources that allow them to control their fertility and mortality rates.

Correct answer: B 
 
Explanation:
The correct answer is B. Least-cost industrial locations.
 
The concept of least-cost industrial locations refers to the idea that companies will locate their factories in areas where the costs of production are lowest. This can include areas with low labor costs, low transportation costs, and low regulatory costs. In the case of LDCs, companies may be attracted to these countries because of their lower labor costs and other costs of production compared to MDCs.

Secularists believe that religion is a personal matter and should not be imposed on others through laws or government policies. They also believe that religion can be a source of conflict and oppression, and that it should be kept separate from the state and society.

 Due to population changes, political boundaries must be redrawn so that districts are more representative of the new population numbers.

 D. census taking 
 E. geopolitics [/INST] </s>",C," #C 
The correct answer is C. gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to favor one political party over another. It is often used to maintain or increase the power of a dominant political party by redrawing district boundaries to include more voters from the dominant party's base and fewer voters from the opposing party's base. This can result in distorted district boundaries that do not accurately reflect the demographics of the population.

 B. Literacy rate 
 C. Per capita gross domestic product 
 D. Immigration rate

The correct answer is:

B. Literacy rate 

Explanation:

The base of the population pyramid refers to the number of people in the working-age group (usually defined as 15-64 years old). An increase in the literacy rate would broaden the base of the population pyramid because it would increase the number of people in the working-age group who are literate and therefore more likely to be employed and contribute to the economy.

The correct answer is: E. European cities have narrow streets and low-rise buildings in their CBDs. 
 
Explanation: European cities have historically had narrow streets and low-rise buildings in their CBDs, which are often characterized by a mix of old and new buildings, and a focus on pedestrian-friendly and public transportation-friendly design. This is in contrast to many world cities, which have high-rise buildings and wide streets, and are often designed with a focus on automobile traffic.
