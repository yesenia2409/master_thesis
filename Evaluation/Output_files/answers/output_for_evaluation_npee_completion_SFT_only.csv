Sediment transport by running water is a process that occurs when water flows through a river or stream. The water carries sediment, such as sand, gravel, and rocks, and transports it downstream. The sediment can be transported by the water in several ways, including:

1. Bedload: The sediment is carried by the water and moves along the river or stream bed.
2. Suspension: The sediment is suspended in the water and is carried by the current.
3. Surface runoff: The sediment is carried by the water as it flows over the surface of the land.

The main methods of sediment transport by running water are:

1. Gravity: The sediment is carried by the water due to the force of gravity.
2. Friction: The sediment is carried by the water due to the friction between the sediment and the water.
3. Turbulence: The sediment is carried by the water due to the turbulence caused by the flow of the water.

1. Concentration gradient: The concentration gradient of the substance in the solution affects the rate of transport. A higher concentration gradient results in a higher rate of transport.

2. Diffusion coefficient: The diffusion coefficient of the substance in the solution affects the rate of transport. A higher diffusion coefficient results in a higher rate of transport.

3. Particle size: The size of the particles in the solution affects the rate of transport. Larger particles have a lower rate of transport due to the larger diffusion distance.

4. Temperature: The temperature of the solution affects the rate of transport. An increase in temperature results in a higher rate of transport.

5. pH: The pH of the solution affects the rate of transport. A change in pH can alter the solubility of the substance, which can affect the rate of transport.

6. Turbulence: The level of turbulence in the solution affects the rate of transport. Incre"
