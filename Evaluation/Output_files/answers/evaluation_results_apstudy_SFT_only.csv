 The umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates is known as 
 A. the Coriolis effect 
 B. plate tectonics 
 C. hotspots 
 D. the Richter Magnitude Scale 
 E. the subduction zone [/INST] </s>",B," #B 
The correct answer is #B. 
The umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates is known as #B. plate tectonics. 
The Coriolis effect is the apparent deflection of moving objects on the surface of the Earth due to the rotation of the planet. It is not the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates.
The Richter Magnitude Scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes. It is not the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates.
The hotspots are areas of volcanic activity that are thought to be caused by the movement of the Earth's mantle. They are not the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates.
The subduction zone is the area where the oceanic crust is being subducted beneath the continental crust. It is not the umbrella theory explaining the Earth's movement, contact, and flattening of large land plates.
