From a dynamics point of view, a stable system will reach an equilibrium point after the introduction of certain disruptions in the system. The disruptions cause the system to undergo transient state, i.e., an evolution from one point (A) to another (B) until it reaches an equilibrium point, thereafter the system state becaomes constant if no further disruption is introduced to it. A world can be viewed as a system with a collection of all matters (animated and unanimated) and energy (in all sorts of forms). From time to time certain species of plants, animals or insects emerge while others disappear, however the total mass-energy remains the same in the system. The animals or plants that continue to exist from state to state must evolve according to the criterion (or criteria) imposed by the system, otherwise, they too will completely disappear and replaced by other forms of objects, whose existence fulfill the crietrion set by the system. The question now becomes, in our world what is this criterion?

 Extract the areas of science using differential equations in this text in an alphabetically ordered list.A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several variables that relates the values of the function itself and its derivatives of various orders. Differential equations play a prominent role in engineering, physics, economics, biology, and other disciplines.

Differential equations arise in many areas of science and technology, specifically whenever a deterministic relation involving some continuously varying quantities (modelled by functions) and their rates of change in space or time (expressed as derivatives) is known or postulated. This is illustrated in classical mechanics, where the motion of a body is described by its position and velocity as the time value varies. Newton's laws allow one (given the position, velocity, acceleration and various forces acting on the body) to express these variables dynamically as a differential equation for the unknown position of the body as a function of time. In some cases, this differential equation (called an equation of motion) may be solved explicitly.

Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR): GPR is a geophysical method that uses radar pulses to image the subsurface. This technique can be used to map the thickness and internal structure of fluvial deposits.  3. Geomorphological Mapping: Mapping and analysis of topographic, geological, and hydrological features can help in identifying the location and extent of fluvial deposits.  4. Sediment Analysis: Analyzing the size, shape, and sorting of sediment in river deposits can provide information on the flow conditions and energy of the river.  5. Paleoclimatic Analysis: By examining the climate signals preserved in river deposits, researchers can determine how the river system and fluvial processes have changed over time.  6.
