"Is it possible for who has shear Modulus and damping ratio (values) for Shales and Sandstone to share it?
Will use in site response analysis, the same like (Modulus for clay (Seed and Sun, 1989) and damping for clay (Idriss 1990). ","If you use STRATA code (https://nees.org/resources/strata), it has several shear modulus and damping curve as function of plastic index and others geotechnical parameters.","  The shear modulus and damping ratio of shales and sandstones are not easily available in the literature. However, some studies have reported the values for specific types of shales and sandstones. Here are some examples:

1. Shales:

a. The shear modulus of shales ranges from 10 to 100 MPa, with an average value of 30-50 MPa (Kaneko and Yasuda, 1989).

b. The damping ratio of shales ranges from 0.1 to 0.5, with an average value of 0.2-0.3 (Kaneko and Yasuda, 1989).

c. The shear modulus of some specific types of shales, such as the Gadvan Formation in the United Kingdom, has been reported to be around 100 MPa (Bhatia and Srivastava, 2013).

2. Sandstones:

a. The shear modulus of sandstones ranges from 100 to 1000 MPa, with an average value of 300-500 MPa (Kaneko and Yasuda, 1989).

b. The damping ratio of sandstones ranges from 0.1 to 0.5, with an average value of 0.2-0.3 (Kaneko and Yasuda, 1989).

c. The shear modulus of some specific types of sandstones, such as the Navajo Sandstone in the United States, has been reported to be around 1000 MPa (Bhatia and Srivastava, 2013).

It is important to note that the values of shear modulus and damping ratio can vary widely depending on the specific type of rock, its mineral composition, and other factors such as temperature and humidity. Therefore, it is recommended to consult the literature for specific values for the type of rock you are studying.

Is autotrophic metabolism a narrower category or subdiscipline within phototroph diversity and metabolism in geoscience? ,"False. The definition of phototroph diversity and metabolism is that 1, while the concept autotrophic metabolism means that 1","  Autotrophic metabolism is a subdiscipline within phototroph diversity and metabolism in geoscience. Autotrophic metabolism is a type of metabolism that involves the use of energy from light to synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water. This process is essential for the survival of organisms that live in environments where energy from light is the only available energy source.

Phototroph diversity and metabolism in geoscience is a broader category that encompasses all the different types of metabolic processes that occur in organisms that use light as an energy source. This includes autotrophic metabolism, as well as other types of metabolism such as chemosynthesis, which involves the use of energy from chemical reactions to synthesize organic compounds.

Autotrophic metabolism is a narrower category within phototroph diversity and metabolism in geoscience because it is a specific type of metabolism that is limited to organisms that use light as their energy source. Other types of metabolism, such as chemosynthesis, are not considered autotrophic metabolism.

In summary, autotrophic metabolism is a subdiscipline within phototroph diversity and metabolism in geoscience, and it is a specific type of metabolism that is limited to organisms that use light as their energy source."

"Can Middle Oceanic Spreading Ridges be swallowed by a subduction zone?
Middle oceanic ridges are places where new oceanic crust is generated. Does anybody know what happens to these spreading ridges when the oceanic basin starts to be closed? Is there any possibility that the once-active middle oceanic ridge be swallowed into the mantle at a oceanic-continental plate convergence boundary? ","Ridge subduction is an obvious phenomena, as oldest ocean floor is only 200-180Mys. And is possibly one of the mechanism to justify the magmatism within the near-trench fore-arc region, which is otherwise a refrigerated zone. We recently, discussed this subject in Early Cretaceous ridge subduction beneath southern Alaska: I...","  Yes, it is possible for a middle oceanic ridge to be swallowed by a subduction zone. This process is known as subduction of an oceanic plate.

When an oceanic plate is subducted beneath a continental plate, the oceanic plate is typically forced down into the mantle at a subduction zone. If the subduction zone is deep enough, the oceanic plate can be forced down into the mantle at a depth where the plate is no longer in contact with the overlying mantle. This is known as a ""slab"" of oceanic crust.

If the subduction zone is shallow, the oceanic plate may be forced down into the mantle at a shallower depth, where it can remain in contact with the overlying mantle. In this case, the oceanic plate may be metamorphosed and transformed into a ""slab"" of mantle rock.

When a middle oceanic ridge is subducted beneath a continental plate, the ridge can be forced down into the mantle at a subduction zone. The ridge may be broken up into smaller pieces as it is forced down into the mantle, and the pieces may be distributed throughout the mantle.

It is worth noting that not all middle oceanic ridges are subducted beneath continental plates. Some middle oceanic ridges may be preserved as oceanic plateaus or other features, depending on the tectonic setting of the region.

In summary, it is possible for a middle oceanic ridge to be swallowed by a subduction zone, where it can be forced down into the mantle and transformed into a ""slab"" of mantle rock. However, not all middle oceanic ridges are subducted, and some may be preserved as oceanic plateaus or other features."
